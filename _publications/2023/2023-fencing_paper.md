  In fencing, there is a rating system that categorizes all individuals by a letter that is meant to indicate their skill level. The United States is split into six different regions, and the ease of obtaining a higher rating differs depending on which region one lives in. The objective of this experiment was to determine which region has the greatest likelihood of granting a higher rating to fencers. After filtering a spreadsheet found on the official USA Fencing website, the number of raters in each region was procured. Subsequently, a quantification of the relative skill level of each region was determined. This data was then compared in order to reach the conclusion that, for Cadet Women’s Épée fencers during the 2021-2022 season, region four was the easiest region to gain a rating in.
