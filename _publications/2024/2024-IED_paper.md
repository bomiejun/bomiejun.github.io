  Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is a disorder of impulsive aggression that has primarily been studied through a Western, particularly American, lens. Consequently, the portrayal of the disorder does not reflect cultural tendencies in East Asian countries, such as South Korea, where the suppression of emotions has been normalized. This paper delves into the prevalence and treatment of the disorder in addition to proposing a novel screening tool.
