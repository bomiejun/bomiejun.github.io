  The AR Mural is an augmented reality platform that enables collaborative 2D and 3D artistic creation in real-world environments. Built using Unity and deployed to the Microsoft HoloLens 2, the system integrates gesture-based input, real-time avatar tracking, and multi-user functionality to support remote co-creation. Tools such as brushes, shape creators, and object manipulators are accessed through natural hand gestures, and player motion is tracked using a RealSense depth camera and YOLO-based skeletal detection, with pose data transmitted through an MQTT protocol to synchronize avatar movement across devices. The AR Mural bridges the gap between digital design and spatial creativity, offering a novel interface for immersive, collaborative art in augmented reality.
